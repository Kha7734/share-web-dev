                Yes, you have the option to exchange an eligible item instead of
                returning it for a refund. You may be able to process a
                self-service exchange in your Zappos.com account—you will see
                this option in your account if an item is eligible to exchange
                via self-service. If a self-service exchange option is not
                available in your Zappos.com account, you can contact usto
                initiate your exchange. For more terms, please see the
                Zappos.com Shipping Returns & Exchange Policy.

                As a Zappos.com customer you have the option of exchanging an
                eligible item instead of returning it for a refund. You may be
                able to process an exchange yourself for certain eligible items
                in your Zappos.com account. If an item is eligible, you will see
                an option in your account to select an item to exchange, and
                will be provided the instructions and terms that apply to your
                exchange. You also always have the option to contact us via
                phone, chat, or email, and we will gladly assist you with the
                exchange process. Our Customer Loyalty Team is available 24/7
                and more than happy to help!
                <br />
                For more information on our exchange process, please see the
                Zappos Shipping and Return Policy.

                It typically takes about 5-10 business days for your return to
                arrive at our fulfillment center and be processed for refund.
                Once we receive your qualifying return and approve your refund,
                Zappos will credit your original method of payment. Depending on
                your financial institution, please allow an additional 2 to 10
                business days for the credit to post to your bank or credit card
                account. Some customers may qualify for rapid refunds through
                Zappos VIPor other perks.

                If you are unsure of your shoe size, you can measure your shoe
                size. Because the foot is three-dimensional, any two-dimensional
                measuring tool, such as a ruler or Brannock device® can only
                approximate your true shoe size. Please also keep in mind that
                manufacturers use different lasts to construct their shoes, and
                sizing may vary accordingly.

                We are sorry that you were not able to complete your order. The
                selection on Zappos.com is live and reflects what is in stock at
                that moment. Placing an item in your shopping cart does not
                guarantee your right to purchase that item. Until you have
                completed the checkout process, another customer may purchase
                the item even if it is in your cart. If that happens, you will
                receive a message on the shopping cart page informing you that
                the item is no longer available and that you should remove it
                from your cart.

                Unfortunately, Zappos.com does not know if an item will go on
                sale or be marked down until it actually happens. It is possible
                for different colors within the same style to have different
                prices. For instance, if a blue bag is selling better than a
                yellow one, one might discount the yellow bag to boost sales.

                Zappos.com is very sorry that the item that you need is out of
                stock. Underneath the size selection dropdown menu, there is a
                link that says "Don't see your size?". If you click on that
                link, you will see a popup that will let you add your email
                address to our notification list. When your size, color, and
                style become available you will receive an automated email sent
                by our system letting you know that your item is available for
                purchase. The notification list does not hold an item for you,
                and it does not obligate you to make a purchase so you are
                welcome to shop around while you wait. Items are available on a
                'first come, first served' basis, so please make sure that you
                place your order quickly.

              <td>
                <b>Acetate:</b> While most items made of acetate are dry-clean
                only, some may be hand-washed in lukewarm water. Do not twist
                the fabric. Iron while the fabric is damp. Press the inside of
                the garment using a low-temperature setting. Use a pressing
                cloth when ironing the outside.<br />

                <b>Acrylic knit:</b> Most acrylic knit garments can be
                machine-washed. Read the label, and check for the proper drying
                option. Some knits retain their shapes best if reshaped and
                dried flat.<br />

                <b>Cashmere:</b> Check the care label before laundering
                cashmere. To hand-wash, use a mild detergent or shampoo. Gently
                squeeze the water through the garment, then rinse until the
                water runs clear. Do not wring or twist. Squeeze out excess
                water. To dry, lay flat on a towel, away from sunlight or
                heat.<br />

                <b>Cotton:</b> Cotton holds up well to home laundering. Remove
                the garment from the dryer promptly to reduce wrinkling. Press
                using spray starch for the crispness of a laundered shirt.<br />

                <b>Cotton blend:</b> Dry cotton-blend garments using your
                dryer's permanent-press or low-heat cycle, and remove
                immediately to reduce wrinkling. Touch up with a steam iron;
                starch for a professionally laundered look.<br />

                <b>Linen:</b> Most linen garments need to be dry-cleaned or
                hand-washed. Follow the instructions on the care label. To touch
                up or press, use a steam iron on a linen setting for a crisp
                look.<br />

                <b>Nylon:</b> Machine-wash nylon garments in warm water. Use a
                low-temperature setting when tumble-drying, and include a dryer
                sheet to reduce static electricity. Use a warm iron to press, if
                necessary.<br />

                <b>Polyester: </b>Read the label. Usually polyester items can be
                machine-washed (cool) and dried (low). Check the label to see if
                air-drying is recommended. Touch up with a cool - never hot -
                iron, if necessary.<br />

                <b>Rayon:</b> Make sure to read the care label for rayon
                clothing. Launder in cool water and a mild detergent. When
                machine-washing, use the gentle cycle and promptly remove
                garments after washing. When hand-washing, do not wring or twist
                the garment. To dry, roll the item in a towel to squeeze out
                excess water. Lay flat to dry. Iron when still damp and with the
                garment inside out to prevent the fabric from becoming shiny.
                Use a pressing cloth when ironing the right side of the garment.
                Pressing cloths can be purchased, or use something as simple as
                a piece of white cotton fabric.<br />

                <b>Silk:</b> Dry cleaning may be required. Some silks are hand-
                or machine-washable. Do not dry silk in a clothes dryer.
                Garments usually look best when professionally dry-cleaned.<br />

                <b>Spandex:</b> Use warm water when hand- or machine-washing
                items made with spandex. Line-dry or use a low temperature
                setting when machine-drying to preserve the elasticity of the
                garment.<br />

                <b>Wool knit:</b> Typically wool knits need to be dry-cleaned,
                but check the label. If hand-washable, use cool water and a
                detergent for fine washables. Squeeze out excess water, then
                reshape and dry flat.<br />

                <b>Wool (lined):</b> Lined garments generally look best when
                professionally dry-cleaned once a season. Between dry cleanings,
                remove surface soil with a brush or damp cloth. Refresh the item
                by hanging it from a padded hanger in a steamy bathroom;
                moisture will help garment shed wrinkles. When touching up with
                an iron, use steam in an up-and-down motion (rather than sliding
                the iron along the fabric).

                to the email, and delete it immediately.<br />

                This type of email is known as a phishing campaign. A phishing
                campaign is an email scam designed to steal personal information
                from victims. Cybercriminals use phishing, the fraudulent
                attempt to obtain sensitive information such as credit card
                details and login credentials, by disguising themselves as a
                trustworthy organization or reputable person in an email
                communication.<br />
                If you are a Zappos.com customer, you can go to your Zappos

                Any pre-paid gift card with a Visa, Mastercard, American
                Express, or Discover logo / insignia on it will be processed
                like an actual credit / debit card, and only one credit card can
                be used per order. If a single pre-gift card does not cover the
                total of your order, we suggest using the balance on the
                pre-paid gift card to purchase a Zappos Gift Certificate. The
                Zappos Gift Certificate can then be used along with a credit
                card or pre-paid gift card to complete the order. If you have
                multiple pre-paid gift cards, you will need to purchase a
                separate Zappos Gift Certificate for each. If you need any help
                with purchasing the Zappos Gift Certificates or placing an
                order, please give our Customer Loyalty Team a call, and we will
                be happy to help! Please also note that in order to use the
                pre-paid gift card on Zappos, it will need to be registered or
                activated by following the instructions on the pre-paid gift
                card itself or on the card's packaging. Also, some cards may not
                be eligible for online purchases. Please refer to the company
                that issued the card for more details.

                It costs nothing. Using Amazon Pay does not add fees to your
                purchases on sites and organizations accepting Amazon Pay.
                Amazon Pay does not add transaction fees, membership fees,
                currency conversion fees, foreign transaction fees, or any other
                fees. Your card issuer, however, may add a foreign transaction
                fee if your card was issued in a country different from the site
                on which you are shopping, as well as any other fees described
                in the terms and conditions for your card.

                Unlike many other websites that have special rules and lots of
                fine print, Zappos.com offers free shipping on all orders placed
                on the website, with no minimum order sizes or special
                exceptions. We believe that in order to have the best possible
                online shopping experience, our customers should not have to pay
                for domestic return shipping either. If, for whatever reason,
                you're not happy with your purchase just complete our easy
                self-service return process. Your returns back to the warehouse
                are absolutely free. With our 365-day return policy, there are
                no special catches or exceptions. For assistance with your
